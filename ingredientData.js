    "Wheat Flour": {
        "What is it?": "Wheat flour is a soft, fine powder made by grinding wheat grains. It’s the main ingredient used to make most types of bread and gives bread its shape and structure.",
        "Why is it added?": "It’s the building block of bread. Wheat flour creates the dough’s structure and texture once it’s mixed and baked.",
        "How is it made?": "Wheat is grown on farms and then harvested and sent to mills. There, it is cleaned and grinded into powder. ",
        "Where does it come from?": "Wheat is grown on farms around the world, especially in areas with lots of sun and flat land. In the U.S., North Dakota, Kansas, and Montana are among the top wheat-growing states."
    },
    "Malted Barley Flour": {
        "What is it?": "Malted barley flour is a soft powder made by grinding barley grains that have been malted—a process where the grain is allowed to sprout and then dried.",
        "Why is it added?": "Malted barley flour helps the dough rise and gives bread a better texture. It does this by breaking down complex starches into simpler sugars that yeast can feed on.",
        "How is it made?": "Barley is first grown and harvested on farms. The grains are soaked in water to begin sprouting. This activates natural enzymes. Then, the sprouted barley is dried in a heated chamber called a kiln. Finally, it’s ground into flour.",
        "Where does it come from?": "In the U.S., most barley used for malting is grown in the northern and western states, especially Idaho, North Dakota, and Washington."

    "Wheat Gluten": {
        "What is it?": "Wheat gluten is a stretchy, elastic protein found naturally in wheat and grains like barley and rye. It gives bread its chewy texture.",
        "Why is it added?": "In bread, gluten gives the dough elasticity. It helps the dough trap air, rise properly, and hold its shape while baking—leading to that chewy, satisfying bite.",
        "How is it made?": "To make wheat gluten, wheat flour is mixed with water and kneaded into a dough. The dough is then rinsed to wash away the starch, leaving behind a sticky, rubbery ball of gluten.",
        "Where does it come from?": "The gluten is derived directly from wheat, which is grown on farms across the world and processed in flour mills."
